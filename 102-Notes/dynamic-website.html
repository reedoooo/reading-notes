        <h4>Variables</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> There are three types of variables. Var is the original way of setting a simple variable. Let creates a variable of which the value might be changed later. Const creates a variable with a set value. </li>
                <li> Javascript variables are identified with unique named called identifiers.</li>
                <li> The (=) is used to assign value to a variable. The (==) sign is set a varible equal to something.</li>
                <li> Variables can be set as "text"/'text' called strings and numbers with no quotes 10.</li>
                <li> Good practice is declaring variables at the beginning of a script.</li>
                <li> If a variable is not assigned a value (i.e. let reedVogt;) it is automatically set to undefined.</li>
                <li> A line that begins with a string stays a string but if it begins with a number you can add a string</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Beginner to Advanced Concepts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Beginner concepts include: Conditional statements, loops, functions and events. Other concepts include objects, asynchronous javascript, and APIs</li>
                <li> Intermediate concepts include: Client-side javascript frameworks, data structures, equalty comparisons, closurs and enumerability and ownership of properties.</li>
                <li> Advanced concepts include: Inheritence and the prototype chain, typed arrays, memory management, and concurrency models and event loops.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Using Prompt() and Confirm()</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> The prompt() function will create a pop-up window displaying a form for users to fill in as well as a cancel and ok button.</li>
                <li> When the user presses OK the value in the prompt() function will be returned.</li>
                <li> Then the document.write("", ) method will update the html with the resulting value.</li>
            </ul>
