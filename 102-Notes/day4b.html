        <h4>Comparison Operators and Assignment Operators</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><h5>Comparison Operators</h5></li>
            <ul>
                <li> Comparison operators allow you to compare two values and determine if they are equal, greater than, or less than each other.</li>
                <li> The value returned will be boolean, indicating true or false</li>
                <li> Comparison operators can be used with any data type in JavaScript, but there are some specific rules for comparing strings and objects</li>
            </ul>
            <li><h5>Assignment Operators</h5></li>
            <ul>
                <li> Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable.</li>
                <li> Some examples of assignments operators are: ("="), ("+="), and ("-=").</li>
                <li> The first assignment operator above is simple whereas the following operator is compound.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>For Statements and While Statements Loops</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><h5>For Statement Loops</h5></li>
                <ul>
                    <li> For statement loops are used when you want to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
                    <li> The syntax for a for loop is:<br><br>

                        for (initialization; condition; increment) {<br> code block to be executed<br>
                        } <br></li>
                    <li> The initialization is executed before the loop starts, the condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration, and the increment is executed at the end of each iteration. If the condition is true, the code block is executed. If the condition is false, the loop ends.</li>
                    <li> The increment or decrement statement is executed at the end of each iteration and is used to update the loop counter</li>
                </ul>
                        <li><h5>While Statement Loops</h5></li>
                <ul>
                    <li> While statement loops are used when you want to repeat a block of code an unknown number of times. The while loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.</li>
                    <li> The syntax for a while loop is:<br><br>

                        while (condition) {<br>
                        code block to be executed<br>
                        }<br></li>
                    <li> The condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration. If the condition is true, the code block is executed. If the condition is false, the loop ends.</li>
                    <li> While loops are often used when the number of iterations is not known in advance</li>
                    <li> The break and continue statements can be used to interrupt or skip iterations in a while loop</li>
                </ul>
