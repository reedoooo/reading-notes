            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              400’s = Client error status codes, indicating that the server

              500’s = Server error status codes, indicating that the server

            </li>
            <li>
              Status code 202 means that the request has been accepted for

            <li>
              If an update didn't return data to a client, the appropriate code

            </li>
            <li>
              If a resource used to exist but no longer does, the appropriate
              code to use would be 410 Gone.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 'Forbidden' status code is 403 Forbidden, indicating that the
              client does not have access rights to the content.

              It is important to pull the MongoDB database string out of the
              server and put it into the .env file for security purposes.

              Middleware is software that acts as a bridge between an operating
              system or database and applications, managing communication
              between them.
            </li>
            <li>
              app.use(express.json()) is a built-in middleware function in
              Express that parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.
            </li>
            <li>
              The /:id in a route is a parameter that can be accessed in the
              request object's params property, allowing for dynamic routing.
            </li>
            <li>
              The main difference between PUT and PATCH is that PUT updates the
              entire resource, while PATCH updates only the specified fields of
              the resource.
            </li>
            <li>
              To make a default value in a schema, you can set a default
              property in the schema definition.
            </li>
            <li>
              A 500 error status code means that there was an internal server
              error that prevented the server from fulfilling the request.
            </li>
            <li>
              The difference between a status 200 and a status 201 is that a
              status 200 means that the request was successful, while a status
              201 means that the request was successful and a new resource has
              been created.
