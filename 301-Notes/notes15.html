          <h4>What is OAuth?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              OAuth is an open standard protocol that enables users to grant
              access to their protected resources without sharing their
              credentials, such as their username and password, with third-party
              applications. Instead, OAuth provides a secure and standardized
              way for users to authenticate themselves using a third-party
              service like Google or Facebook. This protocol enables user
              authentication in a secure and reliable way, and it is commonly
              used in web applications and APIs.

          <h4>What is OpenID?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              OpenID is an open standard protocol that allows users to
              authenticate their identity with a third-party provider (e.g.,
              Google or Facebook) and then use that identity to access other
              websites or applications. It is commonly used in web applications
              and APIs to provide a more seamless user authentication
              experience.

          <h4>Authorization and Authentication Flows</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity,
              while authorization is the process of granting access to specific
              resources or actions based on the user's identity and permissions.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are several different flows for authentication and
              authorization, each designed for different use cases:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Authorization Code Flow is an OAuth flow that involves
                exchanging an authorization code for an access token. This flow
                is commonly used for server-to-server communication or in
                situations where the client application can securely store the
                client secret.
              </li>
              <li>
                Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)
                is a more secure version of the Authorization Code Flow that
                involves using a dynamically generated secret (known as a "code
                verifier") instead of the client secret to authenticate the
                client application.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implicit Flow with Form Post is an OAuth flow that involves
                returning the access token to the client application in the URL
                fragment instead of the response body. This flow is commonly
                used for single-page applications (SPAs) where the client
                application does not have a backend server to store the client
                secret.
              </li>
              <li>
                Client Credentials Flow is an OAuth flow that involves the
                client application authenticating with the authorization server
                using its own credentials (e.g., client ID and client secret) to
                request an access token for itself.
              </li>
              <li>
                Device Authorization Flow is an OAuth flow that involves the
                user authorizing access to their protected resources on a device
                that does not have a web browser (e.g., a TV or game console).
                The device displays a code that the user must enter on a
                separate device (e.g., a phone or computer) to complete the
                authentication process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Resource Owner Password Flow is an OAuth flow that involves the
                client application requesting the user's credentials (e.g.,
                username and password) and exchanging them for an access token.
                This flow is not recommended for most use cases because it
                requires the client application to store the user's credentials,
                which can be a security risk.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
