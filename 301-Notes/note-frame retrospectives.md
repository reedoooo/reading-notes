# Retrospective

- My name is Reed and I'm a student at CodeFellows Academy coding bootcamp. Every day we have to write something called a retrospective to reflect on the day.
- Prompt: Write a retrospective for me using the notes I provide in the numbered list below. Fill in information that I do not provide. For example, if I don't provide what I learned today, you must take the details I provided about my day and fill in the missing information.
- Definition: Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection. The retrospective must answer the following questions:
  - What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?
  - What did I learn today?
  - What should I do differently next time?
  - What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
  - Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- Below is a list of details about my day:
    1. detail
    2. detail
    3. detail
    4. detail
    5. Puzzler: topic
    6. Assignment Status: (complete/incomplete)
