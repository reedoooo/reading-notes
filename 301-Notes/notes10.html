            <h4>What is a ‘call’?</h4>
            <p>
              A 'call' refers to the invocation of a function in JavaScript.
              When a function is called, the execution of the function is
              temporarily paused while the function is executed, and then the
              program resumes execution from where it left off.
            </p>
            <h4>How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?</h4>
            <p>
              JavaScript is single-threaded, which means that only one 'call'
              can be processed at a time. When a function is called, it is added
              to the call stack, and it is not removed from the stack until its
              execution is complete.
            </p>
            <h4>What does LIFO mean?</h4>
            <p>
              LIFO stands for 'Last-In-First-Out'. In the context of the
              JavaScript call stack, this means that the most recently added
              function is the first to be removed from the stack when its
              execution is complete. This ensures that functions are executed in
              the order in which they were called.
            </p>

            <p>An example of a call stack for the following code:</p>
            <pre>
                function add(a, b) {
                return a + b;
                }
                function multiply(a, b) {
                return a * b;
                }

                function square(n) {
                return multiply(n, n);
                }

                function calculate() {
                var x = add(1, 2);
                var y = square(x);
                return y;
                }

                calculate();
                </pre>
            <p>Call Stack:</p>
            <pre>
                calculate
                square
                multiply
                add
            </pre>
            <h4>What causes a Stack Overflow?</h4>
            <p>
              A stack overflow occurs when the call stack exceeds its maximum
              size. This can happen when a function calls itself recursively
              without a proper termination condition. Each recursive call adds a
              new frame to the call stack, and if there are too many recursive
              calls, the call stack will eventually run out of space.

            <h4>What is a ‘reference error’?</h4>
            <p>
              A 'reference error' occurs when a variable or function is
              referenced but has not been declared. This could happen, for
              example, if a variable is misspelled or if a function is called
              before it is defined.
            </p>
            <h4>What is a ‘syntax error’?</h4>
            <p>
              A 'syntax error' occurs when the JavaScript code violates the
              language syntax rules. This could happen, for example, if a
              closing bracket is missing, or if there is a typo in a keyword.
            </p>
            <h4>What is a ‘range error’?</h4>
            <p>
              A 'range error' occurs when a value is not within an expected
              range. This could happen, for example, if an array index is
              negative, or if a number is outside the valid range for a
              mathematical operation.
            </p>
            <h4>What is a ‘type error’?</h4>
            <p>
              A 'type error' occurs when an operation is performed on a value of
              the wrong type. This could happen, for example, if a string is
              treated as a number, or if a function is called with the wrong
              number or type of arguments.
            </p>
            <h4>What is a breakpoint?</h4>
            <p>
              A breakpoint is a point in the JavaScript code where the execution
              is paused. This is typically used for debugging purposes, to allow
              the programmer to inspect the state of the program at that point
              in time.
            </p>
            <h4>What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?</h4>
            <p>
              The word 'debugger' is used to insert a breakpoint into the
              JavaScript code. When the program is run in a debugger
              environment, the execution will pause at the point where the
              'debugger' statement is located, allowing the programmer to
              inspect the state of the program at that point in time.
