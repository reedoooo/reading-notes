# How to Choose a Text Editor
***

## Introduction to Text Editors  
What is a text editor? A text editor is a peice of software held either locally or publically, that is used to write and manage text; generally in association website development. A couple things to look for in a text editor include:  
 1. code completion: This feature helps you write faster by auto-completing lines of text that are often repeated. For example: Someone writing a blog site in HTML would want an editor that can complete their paragraph tags <p> by adding on their closing tag </p>
 2. syntax highlighting: This feature essentially simplifies viewing your code by highlighting different aspects with different colors. For example: if and for loops might be purple, while variables might be blue. 
 3. a variety of themes: Themes are different overall color schemes for your editor. Most coders will use a darker theme, since it reduces eye strain during long coding sessions.  
 4. the availability of certain extensions: It is ideal that as coders become more advanced, so do their editors. As one becomes more experienced they require extensions to give them certain extra abilities that a basic code editor just doesn't include. 

Overall the purpose of a preffered text editor is to write text or code more efficiently. So at the end of the day it just comes down to preference.
