# How to Choose a Text Editor

## Introduction to Text Editors  
What is a text editor? A text editor is a peice of software held either locally or publically, that is used to write and manage text; generally in association website development. A couple things to look for in a text editor include:  
 1. code completion: This feature helps you write faster by auto-completing lines of text that are often repeated. For example: Someone writing a blog site in HTML would want an editor that can complete their paragraph tags <p> by adding on their closing tag </p>
 2. syntax highlighting: This feature essentially simplifies viewing your code by highlighting different aspects with different colors. For example: if and for loops might be purple, while variables might be blue. 
 3. a variety of themes: Themes are different overall color schemes for your editor. Most coders will use a darker theme, since it reduces eye strain during long coding sessions.  
 4. the availability of certain extensions: It is ideal that as coders become more advanced, so do their editors. As one becomes more experienced they require extensions to give them certain extra abilities that a basic code editor just doesn't include. 

Overall the purpose of a preffered text editor is to write text or code more efficiently. So at the end of the day it just comes down to preference.  

## Text Editors vs IDEs
    Text Editors: Implicated in the name, text editors are used to edit text as well as manage text and files.   
    
    IDES: An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the amalgamation of different software. It is able to edit text, manage files, compile code and debug programs. An IDE is typically used by more advanced coders to simplify their work flow. Starting with the singular text editing function is the best way to prepare for using an IDE.    
    
    Options: The following are some general options for beginner coders to use to edit text
        * NotePad++ (for windows only)
        * TextWrangler (for macOS only)
        * Visual Studio Code
