                <h4>Reading: Intro to JWT</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties.</li>
                    <li>JSON Web Tokens should be used when a stateless and secure method of authentication or information exchange is needed.</li>
                    <li>Claims are expected in the payload component of a JWT.</li>
                    <li>JWTs alone do not guarantee security; the integrity and authenticity of the token must be verified through the signature.</li>
                    <li>When sending a JWT, both the sender and the receiver must know the secret key used to sign the token.</li>
                    <li>Concatenated content and secret should not be sent and received directly to a non-technical recruiter; secure communication channels and encryption methods should be used.</li>

                <h4>Videos: JWTs Explained</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>JWTs are useful for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications. They provide a secure and self-contained way to transmit information (claims) between different parties. JWTs are widely adopted, compact, and can be easily validated by the recipient without needing to consult a centralized server. They enable stateless authentication, simplify session management, and support distributed systems and APIs.</li>
                    <li>JWT is Compact and self-contained. Describe how this is useful to a non-technical friend.
                        The compactness and self-contained nature of JWTs make them useful to a non-technical friend because they can be easily transmitted as a single string in various communication protocols (such as HTTP headers or URL parameters) without the need for additional server-side lookups. This means that the information contained within the JWT, such as user identity or permissions, is included directly in the token itself. As a result, the recipient can quickly and independently verify the authenticity and integrity of the token without relying on external resources or databases.</li>

                    <li>The three components of a JWT signature are the header, payload, and secret key.<ul>

                    
                        <li>The header contains the algorithm used for signature generation (e.g., HMAC, RSA) and the token type (e.g., JWT).</li>
                        <li>The payload contains the claims or information about the subject (e.g., user ID, permissions, expiration time).</li>
                        <li>Signature is created by signing the concatenation of the encoded header and payload using a secret key or private key. The signature ensures the integrity and authenticity of the token.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
