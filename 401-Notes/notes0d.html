          <h4>Top 5 Data Structures</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h5>Linked Lists</h5>
              <p>
                A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a
                separate object. Each element (that is, node) of a list consists
                of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The
                last node has a reference to null. There are two types of linked
                lists: singly-linked lists and doubly-linked lists.

            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Arrays</h5>
              <p>
                An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory
                locations. It is the simplest and most widely used data
                structure. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type
                together, which can be accessed by their index number (position
                of the element in the array).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Hash Tables</h5>
              <p>
                A Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an
                associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array
                format, where each data value has its own unique index value.
                Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the
                desired data.

            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Stacks and Queues</h5>
              <p>
                A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a
                Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) manner. In a stack, a new element is
                added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. A
                queue is a linear data structure that stores items in First In
                First Out (FIFO) manner. With a queue, the first element is
                removed first, and the last element is removed in the end.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Graphs and Trees</h5>
              <p>
                Graphs and trees are non-linear data structures that represent a
                set of objects connected through some relationship. Trees are a
                type of graph with additional constraints: they do not contain
                any cycles and have a specified root node. Graphs can be used to
                represent many real-world things such as systems of roads,
                flights among airports, how the Internet is connected, etc.
                Trees are used in many areas of computer science, including
                operating systems, graphics, database systems, and computer
                networking.

          <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
          <h4>Choosing the Right Data Structure</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a
              particular problem, one of the more important things to consider
              is the nature of the operations that you will be performing on the
              data. For example, if you will be frequently accessing elements by
              index, an array would be a good choice since it allows for
              constant-time access. However, if you're going to be frequently
              adding and removing elements, a linked list might be more
              appropriate, as these operations can be done in constant time if
              you have a pointer to the right location. Similarly, if you need
              to frequently check if a certain element is in the set, a hash set
              or a binary search tree could serve you well.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Avoiding Infinite Recursive Call Stack</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, we need to ensure two
              things. First, we need to have a base case in our recursive
              function. A base case is a condition in which the function will
              stop making further recursive calls and start returning values.
              This usually involves a condition that checks if the input is at
              its simplest form, at which point a simple, non-recursive result
              can be returned. Second, each recursive call should bring us
              closer to the base case. This typically means that the input for
              the next recursive call should be a "smaller" or "simpler" version
              of the current input. By ensuring these two conditions, we can
              prevent infinite recursion and thus avoid an infinite recursive
              call stack.
