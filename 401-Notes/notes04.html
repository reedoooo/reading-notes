                <li>The best fit for a complex query intensive environment is a SQL database.</li>
                <li>The best fit for hierarchical data storage is a NoSQL database.</li>
                <li>Differences in scalability between a SQL and NoSQL database:
                    <ul>
                        <li>SQL databases require vertical or horizontal scaling, while NoSQL databases are designed
                            for horizontal scalability from the beginning.</li>
                        <li>Scaling a SQL database can be more challenging and may require complex techniques like
                            sharding or partitioning.</li>
                        <li>NoSQL databases can easily distribute data across multiple servers, allowing for seamless
                            scaling by adding more servers to the cluster.</li>

            <h4>SQL Modeling Techniques</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A one-to-many relationship in data tables represents a relationship where one record in a table
                    is associated with multiple records in another table. We relate them by using a foreign key in
                    the "many" table that references the primary key of the corresponding record in the "one"
                    table.</li>
                <li>Prior to designing a relational database, it might be useful to create a visual diagram, such as
                    an entity-relationship diagram (ERD), of the database tables and their relationships.</li>
                <li>A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table, while a foreign key is a field in
                    a table that refers to the primary key of another table. Primary keys ensure data integrity and
                    uniqueness, while foreign keys establish relationships between tables.</li>

            <h4>Videos: SQL vs NoSQL</h4>
           
            <ul>
                <li>In SQL syntax, keywords are reserved words used for specific operations, while parameters are
                    values passed into SQL statements at runtime.</li>
                <li>Normalization, within the context of schemas and data, refers to the process of organizing data
                    in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency.</li>
                <li>One-to-one relationship: Each record in one table is associated with exactly one record in
                    another table.
                </li>
                <li>One-to-many relationship: Each record in one table is associated with multiple records in another
                    table.</li>
                <li>Many-to-many relationship: Multiple records in one table are associated with multiple records in
                    another table, requiring a junction table to represent the relationship.</li>

            <h4>Bookmark and Review: Sequelize API</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>After reading and reviewing the class README, my learning goals are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>To understand the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases and their suitability for
                            different scenarios.</li>
                        <li>To learn about one-to-many relationships in database modeling and how to establish them
                            using foreign keys.</li>
                        <li>To grasp the importance of visualizing database structures using entity-relationship
                            diagrams.</li>
                        <li>To comprehend the role of primary keys and foreign keys in maintaining data integrity.
                        </li>
                        <li>To understand the distinction between keywords and parameters in SQL syntax.</li>
                        <li>To gain a clear understanding of normalization and its significance in database design.
                        </li>
                        <li>To be able to explain the different types of relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many,
                            many-to-many) to non-technical individuals, such as recruiters.</li>
                        <li>To explore the Sequelize API and its capabilities for working with SQL databases in
                            JavaScript applications.</li>
                    </ul>
