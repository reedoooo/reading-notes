                <ul>
                    <li>View: This is a container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls.</li>
                    <li>Text: This component displays read-only text to the user. It can be styled and nested, but doesn't allow for raw user input or editable text.</li>
                    <li>Image: This component is used to display different types of images, including network images, static resources, temporary local images, and images from local disks, such as the camera roll.</li>

                <h4>Expo and React Native</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps.</li>
                    <li>Expo simplifies the process of developing a React Native app by handling a lot of the complexities and challenges. Hence, it can be referred to as the managed workflow.</li>
                    <li>The difference between React Native and Expo is that while React Native is a framework for building native apps using JavaScript and React, Expo can be understood as a sort of wrapper around React Native which offers additional, convenient functionalities.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Ejecting in Expo</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ejecting in Expo refers to the process of switching from the managed workflow (using Expo's services) to the bare workflow (using only React Native and its libraries).</li>
                    <li>You should not eject if you want to continue using Expo's convenient features and don't need to write custom native code.</li>
                    <li>You might choose to eject if you need to write custom native code or integrate with a specific native library that is not supported by Expo.</li>
