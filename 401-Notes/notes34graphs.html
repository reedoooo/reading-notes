                <h4>What is a Graph?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A graph is a non-linear data structure that represents a pictorial structure of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links.</li>
                    <li>The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges.</li>
                    <li>The vertices may also have additional information called 'weights' associated with them.</li>
                    <li>Graphs are used to represent networks, which include computer networks, social networks, biological networks, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Concepts in Graphs</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A vertex (or node) is the fundamental unit of which graphs are formed. In a diagram of a graph, a vertex is usually represented as a dot with a label.</li>
                    <li>An edge (or arc) is an unordered pair of vertices that are considered adjacent. Edges may be directed or undirected.</li>
                    <li>A path in a graph is a sequence of edges connecting two vertices.</li>
                    <li>A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.</li>
                    <li>A graph without cycles is called an acyclic graph. A directed graph without cycles is called a directed acyclic graph or DAG.</li>
                </ul>
