                <h4>Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within your organization.</li>
                    <li>An example of RBAC is an HR system where different users have different levels of access to HR records. Admins can create, read, update, and delete any records while Managers can read and update their team records, and employees can read their own records.</li>
                    <li>The benefits of RBAC include reducing administrative work and error, improving compliance, and maximizing operational efficiency.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Comparing react-cookie library and react-cookies component</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>React-cookie features include cookie support for both client and server and allows you to set, get and remove cookies.</li>
                    <li>React-cookies features include cookie encoding/decoding, secure cookie options and it allows you to set, get and remove cookies as well.</li>
                    <li>The preference for either library would depend on the specific needs of the project. If support for both client and server is needed, react-cookie might be more suitable. If secure cookie options are a priority, react-cookies might be a better choice.</li>
