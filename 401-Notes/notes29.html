                <h4>Extracting State Logic into a Reducer</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Motivation for adding a reducer: To manage more complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.</li>
                    <li>Actions in the context of a reducer: Actions are objects that contain information about what happened and what needs to change. They're different from setting state directly because they describe a user's action, not the new state.</li>
                    <li>Common list operation that useReduce is named for: Reducing a collection of values down to a single value.</li>
                    <li>Switching from useState to useReducer: When state logic becomes complex due to multiple sub-values, or when the next state depends on the previous one, it's good to switch to useReducer.</li>
                </ul>
