      <h2 class="term-title">Recursion</h2>
      <p class="term-definition">
        Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself
        repeatedly until it reaches a specific condition, known as the base
        case. It is a way of solving problems by breaking them down into
        smaller, similar subproblems and solving them in a recursive manner.
      </p>
      <p class="term-definition">
        When a function encounters a recursive call, it essentially pauses its
        execution and starts executing a new instance of the same function. This
        process continues until the base case is reached, at which point the
        function starts returning values to the previous instances in the call
        stack, allowing them to continue their execution.
      </p>
      <p class="term-definition">
        Recursion can be a powerful technique for solving problems that can be
        divided into similar subproblems. However, it's important to ensure that
        recursive functions have a well-defined base case and that the recursive
        calls progress towards reaching the base case. Otherwise, the recursion
        may lead to infinite loops or excessive memory usage.
      </p>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p class="term-definition">
        Let's consider an example of calculating the factorial of a number using
        recursion:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}

console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
    </pre
      >
      <p class="term-definition">
        In this example, the <code>factorial</code> function calculates the
        factorial of a given number. It uses recursion by calling itself with a
        smaller number until it reaches the base case when <code>n</code> is 0.
        The result is obtained by multiplying <code>n</code> with the factorial
        of <code>n - 1</code>.
