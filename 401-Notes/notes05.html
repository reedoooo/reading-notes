          <h4>Teaching: Linked Lists</h4>
          <p>
            For my teaching, I will provide a walk-through example to explain
            the concept of linked lists.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Introduction:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Linked lists are a data structure consisting of nodes where
                  each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next
                  node.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory
                  and can easily grow or shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Example:
              <ul>
                <li>Imagine a linked list representing a shopping list:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The first node contains the data "Apples" and a reference to
                    the next node.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The second node contains the data "Bananas" and a reference
                    to the next node.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The third node contains the data "Oranges" and a reference
                    to the next node.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The last node is a special node that indicates the end of
                    the list.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Advantages of Linked Lists:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Dynamic size: Linked lists can grow or shrink as needed
                  without wasting memory.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Efficient insertions and deletions: Inserting or deleting
                  nodes in a linked list can be done with constant time
                  complexity if we have a reference to the node where the
                  operation needs to be performed.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Disadvantages of Linked Lists:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Access time: Accessing a specific node in a linked list
                  requires traversing the list from the beginning, resulting in
                  linear time complexity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Extra memory: Linked lists require additional memory to store
                  the references to the next nodes.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

          <h4>Review: What's a Linked List, Anyway pt1</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Linked lists are a data structure made up of nodes that are linked
              together by references.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node
              in the list.
            </li>
            <li>
              The first node is called the head, and the last node is called the
              tail.
            </li>
            <li>
              Linked lists can be singly linked (with one reference to the next
              node) or doubly linked (with references to both the next and
              previous nodes).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <!-- NOTES SECTION DIVIDER -->
        <div class="new-section">
          <h4>Review: What's a Linked List, Anyway pt2</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Linked lists can be used to implement various data structures,
              such as stacks and queues.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inserting a new node into a linked list involves updating the
              references of the neighboring nodes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deleting a node from a linked list involves redirecting the
              references of the neighboring nodes to bypass the node being
              deleted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Linked lists are suitable for scenarios where frequent insertions
              and deletions are required, but random access to elements is not a
              priority.
