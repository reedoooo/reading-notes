                <ul>
                    <li>The first principle of Redux is that the state of your whole application is stored in one single object.</li>
                    <li>A store is where the state of the application is held, and we use reducers within that store to specify how the state should change based on certain actions.</li>
                    <li>The three Redux store methods given to us by createStore are dispatch, subscribe, and getState. Dispatch is used to send actions to the store, subscribe sets up a listener that gets called every time an action is dispatched, and getState retrieves the current state of the Redux store.</li>
                    <li>Explaining combineReducers() to a non-technical recruiter: combineReducers is a helper function that turns multiple separate reducing functions into a single reducing function. It's like having different departments in a company but having a single manager to handle all the departments.</li>
                </ul>
