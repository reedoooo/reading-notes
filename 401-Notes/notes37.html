                    <li>Creating multiple reducers helps to separate concerns within your application and makes your code more maintainable and easy to reason about. Each reducer manages a particular state.</li>
                    <li>Multiple reducers can be combined using the combineReducers() function provided by Redux. This function takes an object whose values are different reducing functions and merges them into a single reducing function.</li>
                    <li>State in Redux is managed as an immutable object to maintain consistency and predictability in your application. By treating the state as immutable, you can ensure that changes to the state can only occur through actions and reducers, which makes the state changes traceable and easier to debug.</li>

                    <li>combineReducers is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing reducers. It turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function that can be passed to createStore.</li>
                    <li>combineReducers assembles the new state tree by calling every reducer with the corresponding state and action, and combines their results into a single state tree.</li>
                    <li>Initial state in an app using combineReducers can be defined as the default parameter value of the reducer functions.</li>

                    <li>You might want to split your reducing functions as your app becomes more complex to keep different pieces of state managed separately and make your code easier to understand and maintain.</li>
                    <li>The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.</li>
                    <li>A popular convention when naming reducers is to name them after the state slices they manage. This makes it easier to understand which part of the state a reducer is responsible for.</li>
