          <h4>Article 1: First Timers Only</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Website dedicated to helping newcomers get involved in open source
              projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provides various resources to assist newcomers, including websites
              that aggregate projects looking for help, guides on how to
              contribute to open source projects, and a bot that tweets when a
              new first-timers-only issue is posted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Encourages project owners to label certain issues as
              'first-timers-only', demonstrating their willingness to guide
              newcomers through their first PR.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 'first-timers-only' label is significant as it signals to
              newcomers that they are welcome and valued, making it easier for
              them to make their first contribution.
            </li>
            <li>
              First Timers Only was proposed by Kent C. Dodds to encourage new
              people to make their first contribution. Scott Hanselman and
              others also supported the idea, emphasizing kindness in open
              source contributions.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are Twitter accounts and bots, such as @yourfirstpr and
              @first_tmrs_only, which highlight great issues that a newcomer can
              solve to make their first PR.
            </li>
            <li>
              There's also a GitHub app named First Timers that automates most
              of the process of creating 'first-timers-only' issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              First Timers Only is all about empowering newcomers to start
              contributing to open source projects, emphasizing that everyone
              starts somewhere.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Open a pull request for trivial fixes or for work that's been
              discussed in an issue.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pull requests can be opened as drafts or marked as Work in

            <li>
              The submission process involves forking and cloning the
              repository, creating a branch for edits, referencing any relevant
              issues, testing changes, and contributing in the style of the
              project.
            </li>
            <li>
              After submission, contributions may not get a response, may
              require changes, may not be accepted, or may be accepted.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's important to be responsive, respectful, and understanding
              throughout the contribution process.
            </li>
            <li>
              Regardless of the outcome, contributors should be grateful for the
              effort put in by maintainers and remember that open source is made
              possible by people like them.
