            <h3>An introduction to NodeJS and Express</h3>

                  >Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical
                  recruiter.</strong
                >
                <p>
                  Middleware in web development acts as a bridge between the
                  client and server. It performs various tasks like
                  authentication, logging, error handling, and more. It's like a
                  relay race where each runner (middleware) handles specific
                  actions before passing the request to the next runner or the
                  server. It ensures smooth communication and enhances the
                  functionality of web applications.

                <strong>Express the most popular ____ ____.</strong>
                <p>Express is the most popular Node.js framework.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Express is "unopinionated." What does that mean?</strong
                >
                <p>
                  Express being "unopinionated" means it doesn't enforce
                  specific patterns or structures on developers. It allows
                  freedom in organizing code, choosing architectural approaches,
                  and integrating additional tools or libraries. Developers have
                  the flexibility to build applications according to their
                  preferences and needs.

                  >What is a module, and why is modularity useful to us as
                  developers?</strong
                >
                <p>
                  A module is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates
                  related functionality. Modularity is valuable for developers
                  as it promotes code organization and reusability. Breaking
                  down complex systems into smaller, manageable modules improves
                  code maintainability, readability, and testability. Modules
                  can be easily reused across projects, enhancing development
                  efficiency.

                <strong>What is NPM?</strong>
                <p>
                  NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js.
                  It allows developers to discover, install, and manage
                  dependencies (third-party libraries and packages) for their
                  Node.js projects. NPM provides a vast ecosystem of open-source
                  packages that can be easily integrated into applications,
                  saving time and effort in developing common functionality from
                  scratch.
                </p>

              <li>
                <strong
                  >What version of npm are you running on your machine?</strong
                >
                <p>
                  To check the version of npm installed on your machine, open a
                  terminal or command prompt and type the following command:<br />
                  <code>npm -v</code><br />
                  The version number will be displayed in the output.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >What command would you type to install a library/package
                  called 'jshint' into your Node project?</strong
                >
                <p>
                  To install the 'j shint' library/package into your Node
                  project, you would type the following command in the terminal
                  or command prompt:<br />
                  <code>npm install jshint</code><br />
                  This command instructs npm to download and install the
                  'jshint' package and its dependencies into your project's
                  <code>node_modules</code> directory.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>What is TDD?</strong>
                <p>
                  TDD (Test-Driven Development) is a software development
                  approach where tests are written before the actual code
                  implementation. It follows the process of writing a failing
                  test, writing the code to make the test pass, and then
                  refactoring the code. TDD helps ensure that the code meets the
                  specified requirements and provides a safety net for future
                  changes or additions.

                <p>
                  Tests are essential because they help ensure the quality and
                  correctness of software applications. Imagine you're building
                  a house. Tests are like regular inspections that ensure the
                  foundation is solid, the walls are sturdy, and everything
                  works as expected. They catch potential issues early,
                  preventing costly mistakes and ensuring the final product is
                  reliable and meets the desired requirements. Tests provide
                  peace of mind and confidence in the software's functionality.

                      </li>
                      <li>
                        b. Writing tests that are too specific to the
                        implementation details, leading to fragile tests
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        a. Lack of collaboration and communication in defining

                        b. Inconsistent or insufficient testing practices across

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    1. Early detection of integration issues and conflicts

                  Continuous Deployment?</strong
                >
                <p>
                  Continuous Delivery (CD) is the practice of ensuring that
                  software can be released to production at any time. It focuses
                  on automating the delivery process, including testing,
                  building, and packaging, to enable frequent and reliable
                  deployments. Continuous Deployment (CD) takes it a step
                  further and automatically deploys the software to production
                  as soon as it passes the necessary tests and quality checks.

                <p>
                  GitHub is a platform that facilitates collaboration and
                  version control for software projects. In the context of
                  Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, GitHub acts
                  as a central repository where developers can store and manage
                  their code. It allows multiple developers to work on the same
                  project simultaneously, keeping track of changes and enabling
                  seamless collaboration. Additionally, GitHub integrates with
                  various CI/CD tools, enabling automated testing, building, and
                  deployment processes based on the code changes made in the
                  repository.

          What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class
          README?
        </p>
        <p>
          After reading and reviewing the class README, my learning goals are to
          gain a solid understanding of Node.js, Express, and their usage in
          building web applications. I aim to learn about middleware,
          modularity, and the role of NPM in managing dependencies.
          Additionally, I want to grasp the concepts of Test-Driven Development
          (TDD) and the benefits it brings to software development. Finally, I
          seek to comprehend Continuous Integration (CI) and its importance in
          ensuring code quality and efficient collaboration within a development
          team.
