                <h4>Multiple Reducers Example</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating multiple reducers allows us to split the logic of our app into smaller, more manageable chunks, improving code readability and maintainability.</li>
                    <li>We combine multiple reducers using the combineReducers function in Redux.</li>
                    <li>We manage state as an immutable object to ensure that we don't directly modify the state, which helps prevent unwanted side effects and makes debugging easier.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h4>Redux Docs: Using Combined Reducers</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>CombineReducers is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing Redux.</li>
                    <li>CombineReducers assembles the new state tree by calling every reducer with the current state and the dispatched action and combining their results.</li>
                    <li>You define the initial state in an app using combineReducers by providing it as the second argument to the createStore function.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Redux Docs: Combined Reducer Syntax</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>As your app becomes more complex, you would want to split your reducing functions to maintain clarity and organization of your code.</li>
                    <li>The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.</li>
                    <li>It's a popular convention to name reducers after the state slices they manage.</li>
