  <h4>Transforms</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A CSS transform allows the developer to manipulate an element's position, rotation, scale, and skew. This means that elements can be moved, rotated, scaled, and skewed on the screen without having to change the HTML or move the element in the layout flow.</li>
    <li>An example of a transform is using the rotate() function to rotate an image. This could be useful on a website to create a spinning or rotating product feature on a landing page or homepage.</li>

  </ul>
  <h4>Transitions</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A CSS transition allows the developer to smoothly change the value of a CSS property over a set period of time. This means that elements can be transitioned from one state to another, like changing the color of a button on hover, without having to use JavaScript.</li>
    <li>A CSS animation is different from a CSS transition in that it allows for a more complex set of changes to be applied to an element over time. While transitions only change one value at a time, animations can change multiple values and use keyframes to create more complex movements and interactions.</li>

  </ul>
  <h4>Applications</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites are that they make the user interface more dynamic, help guide the user's attention, and can make the website feel more polished and professional.</li>
    <li>Understanding CSS Transitions & Animations is important for me as a developer because it helps me to create more engaging, interactive and responsive user interfaces. Using these techniques can make website look more polished, professional and engaging which is important for user experience and user interactions. Furthermore, it helps me to improve my overall web development skills.</li>
