  <h4>Discussion</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams are trust among team members, a sense of belonging and inclusion, and the ability for team members to speak up and voice their opinions without fear of negative consequences.</li>
    <li>In a previous professional setting I was in, there was a high degree of psychological safety. Team members were encouraged to share their ideas and perspectives, and there was a culture of trust and mutual respect. There was also a strong emphasis on inclusivity, and everyone felt comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.    </li>
    <li>Teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have a positive impact on their company and team members. They are more likely to be innovative and come up with new ideas, and team members are more likely to be engaged and motivated. Additionally, team members are more likely to speak up if they see a problem or have a concern, which can help prevent issues from escalating and causing harm to the company. This can lead to a more positive work environment and improved performance.</li>
