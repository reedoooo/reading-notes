  <h4>HTML Forms</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Forms are an important aspect of web development as they allow users to interact with a website by providing input, submitting data, and receiving feedback.</li>
    <li>When designing a form, it is important to keep in mind the user experience. This includes ensuring that the form is easy to understand, use, and navigate.</li>
    <li>Keep forms simple and easy to understand. Organize form fields in a logical order. Provide clear and concise labels. Use clear and consistent formatting. Validate user input to prevent errors</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Javascript</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Text Input: Allows users to input text into a form field. Checkbox: Allows users to select multiple options. Radio button: Allows users to select a single option from a group. Select: Allows users to select a single option from a drop-down list. Submit button: Allows users to submit the form and send the data to the server</li>
    <li>Events are actions or occurrences that happen on a website, such as a button being clicked, a page being loaded, or a form being submitted.</li>
    <li>Events are like triggers on a website that allow different actions to happen, like clicking a button or filling out a form.</li>
    <li>The first argument is the event type (e.g. "click") and the second argument is the function that will be executed when the event occurs.</li>
    <li>The event object is an object that is passed to the event listener function and contains information about the event, such as the type of event, the target element that the event occurred on, and any additional data associated with the event. The target element is useful because it allows you to determine the specific element that the event occurred on and take appropriate actions based on that element.</li>
    <li>Event bubbling is when an event starts at the most deeply nested element and bubbles up to the parent elements. Event capturing is the opposite; the event starts at the outermost element and moves down to the child elements.</li>
  </ul>
