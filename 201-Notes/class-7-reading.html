  <h4>Domain Modeling</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>We need domain modeling to understand and organize the relationships and rules that exist within a system.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>HTML Table Basics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Tables should not be used for page layouts because they are intended to present tabular data, not to control the layout of a page. Using tables for layout can make it difficult to maintain the code, and can also make it harder for users with assistive technologies to navigate the content.</li>
    <li>thead:used to group the header content in a table. tbody: used to group the body content in a table. tr: used to define a row in a table</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Introducing Constructors</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A constructor is a special type of function that is used to create and initialize an object. Advantages to using a constructor include:
      It allows for easy creation of multiple objects with the same properties and methods.
      It allows for the use of the "new" keyword to create an object, making the process more explicit and clear.</li>
    <li>The term "this" in an object literal refers to the object itself, while in a constructor, it refers to the instance of the object that is being creat</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Object Prototypes Using a Constructor</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Prototypes and inheritance can be thought of as a way to organize and share information, like how a company might have a set of standard procedures and protocols that all employees inherit and can build upon. The prototype is the original set of procedures and protocols, while inheritance allows employees to add their own unique procedures and protocols that build upon the original set.</li>
  </ul>
