  <h4>Getting Started</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The articles basically just goes over what html, css, javascript, etc. mean.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>How the Web Works</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Computers connected to the interent are called clients. Client communicates with server and server responds.</li>
    <li>Servers are computers that stores webpages, sites or apps.</li>
    <li>TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data moves across the internet.</li>
    <li>DNS: Domain Name System is like an address book for websites.</li>
    <li>HTTP: Hypertext Transwer Protocol is an application protocl that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each oher.</li>
    <li>Component Files: A website is made up of many different files, which are like the different parts of the goods you buy from the shop. These files come in two main types: code files and Assets. Code files are websites built from mostly HTML, CSS and JS. Assets is a collective name for all the other stuff that composes a website like music or videos or word documents, etc. </li>
    <li>The process of the webs looks like the following: The browser goes to the DNS server and fidns the real address of the server of the website. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking it to send a copy of the site to the client. This is sent across your internet conneciton using TCP/IP. If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message which means yes this is the site, and then starts sending the websites files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets. The browser assembles the smalls chunks into a complete web page.</li>
    <li>When browsers send requests to servers for HTML files, those HTML files often contain link elmeents referencing external JS scripts. It's important to know the order in which those files are parsed by the browser as the browser loads the page. The browser parses the HTML file first, leading to the browser recognizing link element or script element references to external CSS and JS. As it parses, it sends requests back to the server for CSS and JS files it found. The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS and compiles and executres the parsed JS. As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from the CSSOM tree and exectes the JS, a visual representaiton of the page is paiend to the screen for the user to interact with.</li>
