  <h4>Video and Audio</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s with the introduction of new
      technologies like HTML5 and Flash Player, which allowed for native support of multimedia elements in web browsers.
      This made it easier for developers to embed and control video and audio content on websites without the need for
      additional plugins or software.</li>
    <li>The src and controls attributes in the <video> element are used to specify the source of the video and display
        controls to the user, respectively. The src attribute defines the URL of the video file, while the controls
        attribute enables the player controls such as play, pause, and volume.</li>
    <li>It is important to have fallback content inside the <video> element because not all browsers support the <video>
          element, and some users may have JavaScript disabled. Fallback content allows users to still view the video,
          even if the <video> element is not supported or functioning properly.</li>
    <li>In a short story, <audio> and <video> were characters who were always in competition with each other. They were
          both trying to be the best at capturing the audience's attention, but in the end, they realized that they were
          better together, and they joined forces to create a multimedia experience that was unrivaled.</li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Guide to Grid</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Grid layout differs from Flex in that it allows for two-dimensional positioning of elements, while Flex is
      primarily one-dimensional. Grid uses rows and columns to organize elements, while Flex uses a flex container and
      flex items.</li>
    <li>In Grid layout, a grid container is the parent element that holds all the grid items. Grid items are the child
      elements that are positioned within the grid container. Grid lines are the lines that divide the grid into rows
      and columns.</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>

  </ul>
  <h4>Responsive Images</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, developers should make images responsive
      to improve the performance and speed of their website. Responsive images are optimized for different screen
      resolutions, reducing the amount of data needed to be loaded and increasing the overall performance of the
      website.</li>
    <li>The srcset and sizes attributes are used in the <img> element to define the source of the image and the size of
      the image, respectively. For example:
      <!--<img srcset="image-small.jpg 480w, image-medium.jpg 800w, image-large.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 480px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, 1200px" src="image-large.jpg"></li>-->
    <li>Srcset is more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript because it allows the browser to select the
      most appropriate image source based on the device's screen resolution, rather than relying on CSS or JavaScript to
      change the image source. This improves the performance of the website by reducing the amount of data that needs to
      be loaded.</li>
