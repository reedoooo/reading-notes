  <h4>HTML</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>To create a link we wrap text or other content inside an anchor element and add href.</li>
    <li>href contatins the actual link.</li>
    <li>Make links more accessible to readers by clearly labeling them and putting them in appropriate spots.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>CSS</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Normal flow is the way that webpages lay themselves out without any formatting.</li>
    <li>Block level content fills the available inline space of the parent element conataining it. It grows along the black dimension to accomodate its content. Inline elements are just the size of their content.</li>
    <li>Static positioning is the default that every element gets.</li>
    <li>Benefits of absolute positioning: Absolutely positioned elements no longer exist in the normal document flow. The spacing of the elements in an absolute layout are different and easier to control. </li>
    <li>Fixed means its relevant to the viewport wheras absolute means it's not connected to the normal document flow. </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Javascript</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A function declaration occurs when you define what the function is. Function invocation is placed after the function when you call it and ask it to do its function.</li>
    <li>A parameter is inside of the parentheses of the function and an argument is placed inside as a part of the function.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Misc</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Greater Efficieny: Catching mistakes and getting some fresh eyes on your code after long coding sessions creates more efficient and effective coding sessions.</li>
    <li>Job Interviews: Many company will use pair programming as a part of their hiring process. They'll have the new programmer work on something side by side with a current employee to do things like write fresh code or debug, etc. </li>
  </ul>
