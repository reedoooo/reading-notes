  <h4>HTML</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The alt attribute can be used when photos in an article don't show up due to bad network connectivity. It'll describe what the image should have shown.</li>
    <li>To improve image accessability: Provide information about the image in the text not in the title. Embedding images is another way. Give some alt text to it, provide width and height and set a title on the image.</li>
    <li>The figure element would be useful when you're uploading all your wedding photos to a website. Figcaption would tell the browser that the caption describes the content of the figure attribute.</li>
    <li>A gif is a good choice for everyday things like memes that can be animated, whereas an SVG is better used for things like icons or diagrams that require precision to draw.</li>
    <li>A PNG should be used for a screenshot on your website for precise reproduction of your photo's contents.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>CSS</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The color property effects things like text in the foreground and the background property background-color effects things like body or a text banner that are in the background.</li>
    <li>I would give a friend's empty website a sakura pink background with a light grey banner for the title with an H1 that is also sakura pink. I would give his text a heldana font and 3px spacing. </li>
    <li>When choosing texts for a document it really depends on the type of document. If it's a more serious article it should be something like times new roman, but if it's a website for selling trading cards maybe it could use something more playful like comic sans.</li>
    <li>Fontsize: changes the size of the font. Font weight: changes the boldness of the text. Font style: changes the actually font of the text. </li>
    <li>Letter-spacing: changes the space between the letters. Word-spacing: Changes the spacing between words. </li>
  </ul>
