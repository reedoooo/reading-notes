  <h4>Javascript Object Basics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>An object is the amalgamation of functions, variables, and any other sort of data, into one cohesive and functional entity.</li>
    <li>An object created from functions is called an object literal. The objects contents have literally been written out as it's been created. An advantage of object literals is the simplification of communication to a server that will be stored in a database.</li>
    <li>The difference between an object and an array is really in the amount of data provided. While an array can you massive lists of data, the data of an objective can vary and even hold those lists of objects.</li>
    <li>You would use bracket notation when an objects name is held in a variable and you can't use dot notation to access it. But the value can be accessed using bracket notation.</li>
    <li>The this keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside. In the example shown 'this' is referring to the dog.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Introduction to the DOM</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a representation of object data that provides the structure and content of a document on the web. </li>
    <li>The DOM is a programming interface for web documents represented by nodes and objects that allows javascript to interact with the page. </li>
