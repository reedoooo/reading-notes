    <li>Short Poem: HTTP is the way we communicate<br>
        Sending data from here to there<br>
        Computers talking to each other<br>
        Sharing information without a care<br><br>
        
        Through wires and servers they connect<br>
        Sending bits of code back and forth<br>
        Requesting, responding, and redirecting<br>
        All done with a simple protocol called HTTP, of course</li>
        <li>How files are parsed: The browser parses HTMl files and then from those files it uses and link and script elements to find CSS and JS files which it parses next.
