  <h4>Troubleshooting Javascript</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Syntax errors occur when the code does not follow the correct syntax of the programming language. This includes missing punctuation, incorrect use of keywords, and other similar issues. Logic errors occur when the code follows the correct syntax but does not produce the intended results.</li>
    <li>Syntax errors: corrected by reviewing the code and finding and fixing the incorrect syntax. Logic errors: corrected by reviewing the code and understanding what the intended results were, and then figuring out why the code was not producing those results. Type errors: corrected by reviewing the data types being used in the code and making sure they match the expected data types</li>
    <li>Understanding how to identify, diagnose, and correct errors will be an important skill throughout a developer's career as it will help to ensure that code is working as intended.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>The JavaScript Debugger is a tool that allows developers to step through their code and find and fix errors.</li>
    <li>The JavaScript Debugger is a tool that allows you to step through your code and see what is happening line by line. This makes it easy to find and fix errors in your code.</li>
    <li>A breakpoint is a marker in the code that tells the debugger to pause the execution of the code at that point, allowing the developer to examine the state of the application and step through the code to find the error.</li>
    <li>The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the function calls that are currently executing. It allows you to see the order of function calls, and can help to identify where an error occurred in the code.</li>
